# basic-time-tracker
This is a basic time tracker build with Laravel.
---
To use this project all you need to do is clone the repo and run php artisan migrate.

This is a very basic time tracker that allows you to create projects.

On each project you have the ability to clock in and out.

The project shows the total amount of time spent on each project.

I may add some upgrades in the future.
